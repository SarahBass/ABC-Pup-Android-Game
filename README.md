# ABC-Pup-Android-Game
A Java Spelling Game


 Updated 5 days ago
ABC pup is 2D vector art app game developed in Java for Android.

It is a spelling game inspired by Benchmark Universe Spelling Curriculum, which is the current curriculum used across the United States for Language Arts.

Your astronaut puppy 🐕 travels to different planets, such as planet short a, short e, etc that focus on a vowel pattern.

Everytime you complete a spelling challenge, you earn a new astro pup. Each level has a different breed dog you can earn, and you can visit your dogs and play with them as a reward between levels.

Vowel Bubbles fly in the air( a , e , i, o , u) and you can drag them to complete the word.

For example : C_T -> cut, cot or cat would all be excellent answers, but if you are learning short a, we want to focus on that. A picture of a cat will appear on their scoreboard when they choose cat, but they will not be penalized for choosing cot or cut. An animation of those words (cot, cut) will appear, but they won't earn points.

Solar system 1: 5 levels -short vowels.

Solar system 2: 5 levels - long vowels.

Solar system 3: 3 levels - ar, or - r controlled

Solar system 4: 3 levels er,ir,ur - r controlled

Solar system 5: 4 levels air , are ,ere, eir

When you pass all 10 solar systems , the player will have more than 31 space dogs for 31 levels. Each level coordinates with a dog with the same spelling solar system level 1: A , is a lab (Labrador ) because of the short a sound in the middle. ((An Akita would not be a short a sound, but a schwa e sound.)) As the levels increase , the level of reading required for dog name increases. When you click on the dog name it reads the name for the child emphasizing the spelling pattern. Level 1 dogs are Lab, Ken (kishu ken), pit (pitbull) ,pom (pomeranian), pug For example.

Bonus dogs with similar spelling patterns can be earned while playing.

Levels will include 31 different planets with different themes. As the child plays, any correct word they spell will be added to their dictionary with a picture.
